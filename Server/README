ViveQuake server
----------------

You need the WinQuake source code in C.  Note: it's a misnomer, as this
server will compile and run on most architectures.  Tested on Linux
with:

    git clone git://github.com/id-Software/Quake/
    then make a symlink from here, "src", to the "WinQuake" subdirectory

Run "python quake_build.py" to prepare the "_quake" module.  This uses
cffi, which you can install e.g. with "pip install cffi".

Make another symlink "id1" to the Quake standard directory "id1".

Run "python server.py" to start the server.
